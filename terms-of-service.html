    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the MyBons.ai mobile application ("App") operated by MyBons.ai ("we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>MyBons.ai is a personal journaling application with AI-powered reflection features. You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account.</p>

    <h2>2. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>MyBons.ai offers a free tier with limited features and a premium subscription ("MyBons.ai Premium") with expanded features.</p>
    <p><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Includes up to 3 journal entries per week, 3 AI reflections per week, and access to the first 5 bonsai species.</p>
    <p><strong>MyBons.ai Premium:</strong> Available as a monthly ($2.99/month) or annual ($19.99/year) subscription. Premium includes unlimited entries, unlimited AI reflections, full bonsai garden access, unlimited media attachments, and cloud sync.</p>
    <p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> New subscribers may be eligible for a 7-day free trial. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, you will be charged for the selected subscription plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can manage and cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID Account Settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.</p>

    <h2>3. Physical Products (Bonsai Bands)</h2>
    <p>We may offer physical wristband products ("Bonsai Bands") for sale through our website. These are physical goods, not digital content, and are not processed through Apple's In-App Purchase system. Bonsai Band purchases are subject to separate order terms communicated at the time of purchase.</p>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The App uses artificial intelligence to generate reflections, insights, and mantras based on your journal entries. This content is generated by third-party AI models (OpenAI) and is provided for informational and reflective purposes only.</p>
    <p><strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> AI-generated content is not a substitute for professional medical, psychological, therapeutic, or counseling advice. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact a mental health professional or emergency services immediately. In the US, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988.</p>
    <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness of AI-generated content. Use your own judgment when considering AI-generated reflections and insights.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of all content you create in the App, including journal entries, photos, and videos ("Your Content"). By using the App, you grant us a limited license to process Your Content solely for the purpose of providing App features (e.g., AI reflections, cloud sync).</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for Your Content. You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose or to upload content that violates any applicable law.</p>

    <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, features, code, content, and branding, is the property of MyBons.ai and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or reverse-engineer any part of the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR COMPLETELY SECURE.</p>
    <p>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR AI-GENERATED CONTENT. THE APP IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MYBONSAI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY.</p>
    <p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time for violation of these Terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. Provisions that by their nature should survive termination will survive.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
